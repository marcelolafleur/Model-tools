# Calibrating an OG-Core country model

Transferable lessons distilled from the OG-Core country family (OG-USA, OG-PHL, OG-ZAF, OG-IDN,
OG-BRA, OG-ETH). This is a **method-and-pitfall playbook**, not a table of one country's values —
every number below is an *example*; you re-derive it for your country. Each item is tagged with
**provenance** so you know what is battle-tested vs. emerging vs. novel:

- **[family]** — done the same way across most/all repos.
- **[emerging]** — a good practice in only 1–2 repos (usually OG-IDN/OG-ETH); adopt and propagate it.
- **[net-new]** — not done in any repo yet; do it anyway because it prevents real errors.

Two reading rules:

- **Country tags are provenance, not scope.** `[ZAF]`/`[ETH]`/`[PHL]` record *where a lesson was
  learned and battle-tested* — the evidence trail — never *which country it applies to*. Every method
  here is on the menu for every country. Where applicability genuinely is conditional, the condition
  is a country **characteristic** stated in the item itself (agrarian/informal, aid- or
  remittance-dependent, distressed sovereign, rectangular vs diagonal make matrix) — never a country
  name.
- **Best effort on every block, graded honestly.** Most blocks have a ladder from minimal to ideal
  (flat → progressive → microdata PIT; narrative → structural informality; borrowed → re-tilted
  `chi_n`; naive → value-added `io_matrix`; direct solve → continuation). Calibrate each block at the
  **highest rung the country's data supports**; when the data isn't there, take the lower rung *and
  say so in the docs* — a documented fallback ("chi_n borrowed from OG-USA, uncalibrated") is a
  legitimate calibration, while an **undocumented placeholder is the pitfall half this file exists to
  prevent** (the 0.9 `zeta_K`, the flat 22% PIT, the stray bequest tax). Never let one block's missing
  data stall the rest of the calibration. And for every number — calibration input or validation
  anchor — **actively search for the most authoritative source that exists for this country**,
  starting with the official national institution that owns the number (see the sourcing hierarchy in
  Validation); named sources in this file are roles to search by, not a closed menu.

Always verify a claim against the **actual checked-out ref** of the repo in front of you — sibling
docs sometimes cite a *cousin repo's feature branch* as if it were canonical, and docs drift from
code. Open the file; don't trust memory or a sibling's citation.

## The mental model (read this first)

1. **The packaged `og<xxx>_default_parameters.json` is the source of truth.** `Calibration(p,
   update_from_api=False)` (the default) fetches nothing and overlays only no-op identity values
   (single-industry: `alpha_c=[1.0]`, `io_matrix=[[1.0]]`; empty for multi-industry) — `macro_params`
   and `demographic_params` are `{}` and `e` is `None`. A curated few parameters refresh only when a
   caller passes `update_from_api=True`. **[family]**
2. **Most parameters are weakly identified alone.** The real test of a calibration is whether the
   **joint steady state** resembles the country's economy — validate the SS against a dashboard of
   data moments, not each parameter in isolation. **Lead that dashboard with fiscal data — it is the
   sharpest validator.** Tax collections by instrument (PIT / CIT / VAT+indirect as % of GDP), the
   debt ratio, its foreign share, and the effective real rate on debt are (a) **published precisely**
   by the treasury / revenue service / IMF, to the currency unit; (b) **convention-free** — they map
   one-to-one onto model ratios, unlike GDP / wage / consumption *levels* (arbitrary model units,
   need `factor`), sector *nominal* output shares (numeraire-distorted, never comparable), or `r` /
   K_f/K (open-economy modeling latitude); and (c) **self-checking** via the government budget
   identity (see Fiscal consistency), so a miscalibration surfaces as an inconsistency in the SS and
   as an outright debt runaway on the transition. So a calibration that nails its fiscal ratios is
   validated on its most trustworthy *and* most stability-critical dimension. `factor` itself is a
   fiscal diagnostic — it sets the currency income at which the tax functions are evaluated, so a
   `factor` gap is a mis-collected-tax error, not a cosmetic one. Treat the production / preference /
   earnings moments (sector VA shares, hours, the Gini) as a necessary second tier that fiscal data
   can't speak to. **[emerging: IDN, ETH; the fiscal-first framing net-new: ZAF]**
3. **Single-industry first; multi-industry is a separate, non-destructive file** — its own JSON + its
   own example; the single-industry default keeps working untouched. **Two packaging choices, both
   legitimate — pick per repo, but never hand-write the file (always regenerate from the builder):**
   - *Lean overlay* **[PHL]**: the multisector JSON carries only the parameters that differ (`M`, `I`,
     the per-industry vectors, `alpha_c`, `io_matrix`, the chi conversion); the example loads the base
     JSON *then* the overlay. Pro: small reviewable diffs, and the economy-wide values live in one
     place so they can't drift. Con: **not standalone** — loading the overlay alone silently falls
     back to OG-Core (US-ish) defaults for everything it omits (a real footgun). It is tiny because
     ~97% of the base file is baked demographic arrays (`imm_rates`/`omega`/`rho`) it doesn't repeat.
   - *Self-sufficient file* **[ZAF]**: the builder merges base + multi-industry overrides and writes
     the *full* file, so it loads standalone in one step exactly like the single-industry default. Pro:
     matches the "one file = one calibration" expectation, no footgun. Con: it duplicates the base's
     economy-wide values (including the multi-MB demographic arrays), so it can **silently drift** from
     the base if the base is recalibrated and this file isn't regenerated. Mitigate with the discipline
     of regenerating on every base change (ZAF's choice), optionally backed by a drift-guard test
     asserting every non-multi-industry key equals the base — cheap insurance against a silent, hard-to-
     spot divergence, though some prefer to keep the test surface minimal.
   Never let the single-industry default carry multi-industry values, whichever you pick. **The
   deliverable per representation is exactly one thing loaded one way:** one self-sufficient JSON that
   carries every value the model needs + one example script (baseline + one representative reform),
   mirroring the single-industry `run_og_<country>.py`. Don't ship reform-variant example scripts
   (`*_cit_cut.py`, `*_energy_tax.py`, …) — a reform is a few lines the user edits in the one example;
   parallel scripts just rot and drift. **[family]**
4. **Calibrate effective, not statutory, quantities.** Wherever a large share of activity is
   informal/exempt/uncovered, the calibrated rate = actual collections ÷ the model-wide base, not
   the statutory rate. Apply this **consistently** across every tax instrument (OG-BRA is the
   counter-example — it discounts PIT for informality but leaves payroll at the full statutory rate).
   **[family]**

## Before you start: environment & preflight

- **uv, not conda.** `uv sync --extra dev`, then `uv run <cmd>`. `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth
  for setup — `docs/book/content/contributing/contributor_guide.md` is stale (still conda) in most
  repos. **[family]**
- **Never commit a `uv.lock` change from calibration work.** The lock is Dependabot-managed; if a
  local `uv sync` touches it, `git restore uv.lock`. Confirm `uv.lock`/`.python-version` are not in
  the PR diff. **[family among EAPD-DRB repos: PHL/ZAF/IDN/ETH; PSLmodels repos BRA/USA differ]**
- **Mirror the ogcore version via the resolved `uv.lock`, not the `pyproject.toml` floor.** The
  `ogcore>=` floor strings are NOT synced across repos; the EAPD repos have all converged on the
  same resolved version in the lock. To check "does this repo match its siblings," grep
  `name = "ogcore"` in `uv.lock`, not the floor. **[family]**
- **Model-run preflight — do this before every solve.** Assert the interpreter's imports resolve
  inside the intended checkout/venv (`uv run python -c "import ogXXX, ogcore; print(ogXXX.__file__,
  ogcore.__file__)"` and check the paths) **[emerging: documented as a house rule in
  OG-ETH.informality/INFORMALITY.md]**; and print branch + HEAD of every repo involved plus
  `sys.executable` **[net-new — no repo does the full combo]**. Editable installs, script-dir
  shadowing, and cwd shadowing silently run another checkout's code. This has caught real
  contamination.
- **Confirm before launching runs.** A steady-state solve is ~1–2 min; a full example (baseline +
  reform transition) is several minutes. Propose and let the user launch.
- **The example run is a smoke test, not a correctness check.** `test_run_example.py` (`@pytest.mark.local`)
  only asserts the process is still alive after ~5 min — it never checks SS/TPI values. Numeric
  validation is manual/docs-based (the dashboard). **[family]**
- **CI-equivalent test suite:** `uv run python -m pytest -m 'not local' -q`. **[family]**

## Macro & open-economy block

Method → pitfall → exemplar.

| Sub-block | Method | Pitfall | Exemplar |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_year` | **A calibration decision, not a default: the most recent year the calibration can OBSERVE, not a projection year.** Check which anchors are observations vs extrapolations under each candidate year — the initial debt ratio is the sharp test (it must equal the debt ratio at the START of the start year, i.e. end of the prior year), and levels observed in year X (remittances/GDP, interest actuals) are data for a year-X start but extrapolations for X+1. Changing it regenerates demographics (and everything demographics-derived) via the country's regeneration tool, and re-maps the fiscal glide to the program years | Inheriting a future start year from a sibling repo: PHL shipped start 2026 while its latest data was 2025 — the packaged initial_debt_ratio 0.60 was in fact the beginning-of-2025 value (a 2026 start needed ~0.62), and the 2025-observed remittance ratio was being treated as a 2026 extrapolation | PHL (caught by the user, moved 2026→2025) |
| Debt | `initial_debt_ratio` is *measured* (national/IMF/QPSD series); `debt_ratio_ss` is a *policy anchor* (program target/stance), a separate parameter that shapes the whole SS | Leaving `debt_ratio_ss` inherited/undocumented; not checking whether a debt-ratio jump is a **valuation effect** (FX float revaluing external debt) vs. real deterioration | IDN, ETH |
| `zeta_D` | Default: set = `initial_foreign_debt_ratio` (assume foreign share of *new* issuance = foreign share of *stock*) | Using the realized flow when it's a crisis-period **outlier** (donor surge, debt standstill) — use the DSA's projected medium-term flow instead | USA measures the flow directly; ETH uses the DSA projection |
| `zeta_K` | It's a **marginal fill-share no dataset measures — calibrate it by the level it produces**: tune until the solved SS `K_f/K` matches the IIP foreign-capital share (2-3 SS solves bracket it; PHL sensitivity ≈ 0.4pp of `K_f/K` per 0.01 of `zeta_K`). The normalized Chinn-Ito index is the *prior* locating the plausible range, not the target. **Re-validate after ANY tax-side change** — tax recalibration moves domestic saving, which moves `K_f/K` at fixed `zeta_K` (PHL: honest taxes pushed 0.26→0.14; `zeta_K` 0.4→0.47 restored the 0.20 IIP anchor) | The **`zeta_K = 0.9` placeholder** ("implies high openness") — drives domestic capital `K_d = B − D_d` negative, binds `K_d ≥ 0`, and breaks the transition. Also: treating Chinn-Ito as the target and never solving for the level | Method: IDN, ETH; level-tuning executed on PHL. The 0.9 pitfall: IDN hit it and fixed it, PHL fixed it in #68 |
| `world_int_rate_annual` | **OPEN, investment-grade:** risk-free (~4%) + country sovereign spread. **NEAR-CLOSED/DISTRESSED:** leave at the ~4% benchmark and route country risk through low `zeta_K` + the debt-elastic premium instead | Adding a spread for a defaulted/restructuring sovereign (wrong model); or leaving it undocumented | IDN (open); ETH (distressed) |
| `g_y_annual` | Choose the growth window as **named constants** with a rationale (start after a structural break, end before the latest shock, reject unrepeatable booms). Critically, the SS is a **long-run** state, so `g_y` must be **consistent with the growth the `debt_ratio_ss` anchor assumes** (`GDP growth ≈ g_y + g_n_ss`): if the debt target is a country's stabilization *plan* built on a medium-term recovery, use that recovery's productivity growth (`= medium-term GDP growth − g_n_ss`), not the stagnant realized window | Naive "all history"/inline date arg; **or realized-stagnation `g_y` paired with a stabilization `debt_ratio_ss`** — internally inconsistent (that's the *pessimistic, debt-drifts-up* scenario), so the model's debt won't actually hold at the target | IDN, ETH, PHL. ZAF: realized 0.6% was inconsistent with the 0.765 anchor's ~1.8% growth → raised `g_y` to ~1.4% (= 1.8% − g_n 0.42%) |
| `r_gov` base wedge (`r_gov_scale`, `r_gov_shift`) | `r_gov = scale·r − shift + premium`, and it multiplies the **whole debt stock** in `debt_service = r_gov·D` — so it is an **average/effective** real rate. Keep the LMWW **slope** (`scale`, the estimated sovereign-vs-corporate pass-through), but **re-anchor the `shift`** so the SS `r_gov` equals the country's actual real *effective* rate on debt = interest payments/gross debt (take BOTH from the treasury's own cash-operations/budget report — news stories mislabel fiscal years; PHL's widely-quoted "FY2024" interest figure was actually FY2025) minus expected inflation. **Expect `r_gov < g` for many EMs** — then the debt-stabilizing primary balance `pb*` is a *deficit*, matching how such countries actually stabilize debt ratios while running primary deficits; and state the **consolidation gap** (actual primary balance vs `pb*`) explicitly in the docs, since the stable-debt SS embeds it | The LMWW **intercept** is a cross-country EM average that maps a *nominal USD bond-yield* level onto the model's *real* MPK — it over-predicted ZAF by ~0.5–0.6pp and **PHL by ~3pp** (5.1% vs the ~2.0% the Treasury pays), inflating the debt-stabilizing primary surplus and forcing spending too low. Don't use the 10-yr/ILB *marginal* yield either — that's new-issue cost, not the stock average | ZAF (~3.7%), PHL (~2.0%, `calib/remittances`); IDN/ETH still ship the raw LMWW intercept |
| Remittances `alpha_RM_1`/`alpha_RM_T`, aid `alpha_FA` | Hand-set JSON values, **never fetched**. **Level:** use the *personal* (BPM6) remittance measure — the model's `RM` is household income from abroad — central banks often headline a GDP ratio only for the narrower *cash* (formal-channel) series, ~1pp of GDP lower; derive personal/GDP on one consistent denominator. **Path:** `alpha_RM_1 = alpha_RM_T` pins only the endpoints — `get_RM` compounds `(1+g_RM)/(e^{g_y}(1+g_n))`, so a flat RM/Y **requires `g_RM[t] = e^{g_y}(1+g_n[t-1]) − 1`, a time-varying path** (no scalar works when `g_n` moves; regenerate it with the demographics). `g_RM` is in model growth units — never the nominal-USD growth rate from a press release. The SS never reads `g_RM` (`RM_ss = alpha_RM_T·Y`), so a wrong path corrupts *only* the transition. **Distribution:** ogcore's default `eta_RM` is population-proportional; survey evidence (FIES-type) shows remittance value concentrated at the top. Build group shares as quintile mean income × remittance-share-of-income (equal-count quintiles ⇒ value share follows directly), map to the J groups by interpolating the cumulative distribution, spread per-capita over ages; note the current-vs-lifetime-income ranking caveat (overstates concentration) vs uniform-within-top-quintile (understates it). **Schema: `eta_RM` in the parameters JSON is (S,J)** — the (T+S,S,J) on a live Specifications object is internal tiling | A nominal growth rate in the `g_RM` slot: PHL shipped `g_RM = 0.03` (Dec-on-Dec USD growth) against a ~5.7% model-consistent denominator — RM/Y silently fell 35% below its calibrated share by t≈24, recovering only after t≈100, with nothing in the docs intending it. And the cash-measure trap: PHL's 0.072 came from a BSP headline that was the cash series (personal was 8.1%) | PHL (all three, fixed on `calib/remittances`); ETH (aid) |
| Debt-elastic premium `r_gov_DY`/`r_gov_DY2` | The base wedge is a **country-agnostic** OLS inversion of Li-Magud-Werner (same numbers everywhere). Add the convex Schmitt-Grohé/Uribe term in **centered** form around `debt_ratio_ss`, expand, fold the constant into `r_gov_shift` → premium is **exactly zero at the SS target**, so it only prices transition overshoot: `r_gov_DY = -2·r_gov_DY2·D̄`, `r_gov_shift = base − r_gov_DY2·D̄²` | A live-refresh path that returns the *raw* LMW shift silently **de-centers** the premium and moves the SS — freeze it | IDN, ETH |
| `initial_Kg_ratio` | Solve the model's own SS law of motion `K̄g/Ȳ = (1−φg)·αI / (e^{gy}(1+gn) − (1−δg))`; if the *measured* stock is far above sustainable (SOE-built boom), **start at the measured value and let it depreciate** | Inheriting the sibling-shipped `0.2` undocumented when `gamma_g > 0` (OG-Core's own default is `0.0`; PHL/ZAF/IDN/BRA all ship `0.2`, but only PHL has `gamma_g>0`, so elsewhere it's inert) | ETH only — replicate wherever `gamma_g > 0` |
| Initial household wealth `initial_wealth_ratio` | **Diagnose first**: without the parameter (OG-Core pre-#1189, or left at the 0.0 default), the transition imposes the SS wealth profile rescaled so aggregate B(0) = B_ss. Compute the implied per-household scale `B_ss / get_B(b_sp1, p, "SS", True)` — it measures the demographic distance between the initial and stationary populations, and anything far from 1 hands every initial household a uniform windfall (young population) or confiscation (old), which short-horizon retirees rationally consume/absorb: the fingerprint is a violent year-1-or-2 aggregate consumption spike concentrated in ages 60+ across all j, an investment collapse, a tau_c revenue pulse, and a spurious debt paydown (or the mirror images). **Fix**: set `initial_wealth_ratio` (OG-Core #1189; wealth-to-GDP at t=0 — the anchor is STATIC within the solve because initial wealth is a predetermined state: rescaling households' initial wealth between outer-loop iterations, even damped, drives the initial cohorts into infeasible negative-consumption roots that satisfy the extended FOCs AND pass ogcore's constraint checker, which watches a different object — always read min household consumption from the pickle) from data: `(K/Y_PWT − public capital stock/Y_ICSD) × (1 − IIP foreign-owned share) + domestic-held share × D/Y`. Compute the PWT ratio from the raw current-PPP series pair (capital `CKSPPP…` over output `CGDPOS…` on FRED), never from memory — PHL moved 3.33 (2019) → 3.97 (2023). Cross-check against household-net-worth estimates (UBS databook class — expect them LOWER; they undercount EM real property) and expect initial < SS wealth ratio for a fast-growing EM (a converging-up economy). **Then re-tune the `alpha_G` glide under the new initial condition** — it was fit against the windfall-distorted revenue path | PHL scale factor was **1.625** (63% windfall): retirees consumed at 3–7x SS for years, C jumped 41% for one year, I_d → ~2% of long-run, debt paid down to 50% vs a 60% target — all invisible in reform-minus-baseline tables (both paths share the initial condition), so it survived every reform validation and surfaced only in level exercises. Note the model *forces* B(0) = K_d(0) + D_d(0), so the capital-side data construction IS the model-consistent measure — don't reach for household balance-sheet surveys first | PHL (diagnosis + fix, OG-Core #1188/#1189) |

## Capital share (gamma)

- **Baseline [family]:** `gamma = 1 − labor_share` (ILOSTAT/national accounts), then carve `gamma_g`
  (public capital share) out of the *capital* side. Fine for formal economies (USA).
- **Gollin / self-employment adjustment — for agrarian/informal economies.** Raw labor shares are
  biased because self-employed mixed income is booked as capital. Two distinct methods:
  - *Aggregate triangulation* **[ETH]**: adjust the economy-wide labor share up using non-circular
    evidence — a growth-accounting check `gamma = (r+δ)(K/Y)` (an implausible implied return flags a
    wrong share), the Gollin direction-of-bias argument, and country institutions (e.g. state-owned
    land). State the result as a *range with a center*, not a point estimate.
  - *Cross-sectional rescale* **[multi-industry; PHL feature branch]**: keep the SAM's per-industry
    *dispersion* but rescale so the value-added-weighted mean equals the economy-wide capital share.
- **PITFALL [ETH, verified]:** the `update_from_api=True` path recomputes the **naive** `1 − ILOSTAT`
  and will **silently clobber** a hand-triangulated gamma (e.g. overwrite 0.30 with 0.515), undoing
  the whole firms.md argument. **Remove such curated structural params from the live path entirely**
  (as IDN did) — an `if update_from_api` guard is not enough.

## Earnings (the e ability matrix)

- **Method [family: PHL/IDN/BRA/ETH]:** reuse OG-USA's calibrated `e` matrix as the base and apply a
  **single-scalar exponential tilt** `e_country = e_USA · exp(a·e_USA)`, solving the one scalar `a`
  (bisection) so the model Gini matches the country's target Gini. One number per country, no bespoke
  data collection.
- **Do NOT use the ZAF-style hardcoded-coefficient method** (`get_e_orig`, WID-then-NTA two-step with
  hand-tuned arctan extrapolation) — it needs bespoke per-country re-derivation and isn't a drop-in.
- **Gini-concept trap [issue #33; family-wide risk]:** the target-country Gini and the US reference
  Gini (`gini_usa_data`) **must be the same welfare concept**. Mixing a World Bank PIP Gini
  (consumption-based for many developing countries) against the **World Bank income-concept US anchor
  (`gini_usa_data = 41.5`, WB SI.POV.GINI)** systematically understates the target's inequality. Use a
  matching concept for both (e.g. WID income) and check the docstring default matches the code.
- `lambdas` (lifetime-income groups, J=7) are byte-identical **across the country ports
  (PHL/ZAF/IDN/BRA/ETH)** and never re-derived — only the tilt `a` changes; OG-USA is the J=10 source
  the ports interpolate down from. `factor` is **solved endogenously in the SS**, not a calibration
  input.

## Demographics

- **Method [family]:** the shared `ogcore.demographics` module — fertility/mortality from the UN
  Population Division API, infant mortality taken from the UN age-0 mortality rate (same UN WPP
  series), **immigration solved as the residual** that reconciles consecutive UN population
  distributions (appropriate when immigration data is weak).
- The only per-country input is `country_id` (UN M49 code). **Use a single named constant**
  (`UN_COUNTRY_CODE`) referenced at both call sites — not an inline literal. **[safer: PHL/IDN/BRA]**
- **PITFALL [ETH, regressed twice]:** `calibrate.py` gets refreshed by copying a sibling repo, and the
  hardcoded `country_id` literal was wrong (710=South Africa instead of 231=Ethiopia) — twice, because
  a wholesale file copy forgot to swap it. **Add a regression test** asserting `country_id` matches the
  country being calibrated.

## Labor supply (chi_n)

- **Honest default state [family]:** `chi_n` (the 80-age disutility-of-labor profile) is
  **byte-identical to OG-USA's values in every country repo — never recalibrated to any country's own
  labor data.** The estimation machinery is broken or absent everywhere (USA's is commented out; most
  repos have no `labor.py`; ETH's `labor.py` is orphaned ZAF QLFS code with a missing
  `estimate_chi_n` module — see issue #71).
- **So: treat "chi_n = borrowed from OG-USA, uncalibrated" as the default state of any port, and say so
  explicitly** — never present it as calibrated.
- To actually calibrate it: either (a) a single-scalar re-tilt analogous to the earnings Gini trick,
  matching an aggregate hours or labor-force-participation target; or (b) wire the country's labor
  force survey through a rewritten `labor.py` + a real `estimate_chi_n.py`.

## Taxes & informality

- **The universal method:** every effective rate = collections ÷ base. Apply it to PIT, `tau_c` (VAT),
  CIT (via `adjustment_factor_for_cit_receipts` × `c_corp_share_of_assets`), and `tau_payroll`
  (statutory rate × covered share of the *wage bill*, not headcount — or directly: SSC collections ÷
  the model's labor share of income). **Apply consistently** — OG-BRA
  is a cautionary tale: it discounts PIT for informality but leaves payroll at the full statutory rate.
- **`tau_payroll` is ADDITIVE on top of the ETR function** (`income_payroll_tax_liab = T_I + T_P` in
  ogcore `tax.py`), and with `frac_tax_payroll = 0` the combined take reports on the *iit* line while
  the payroll line shows zero — so a statutory payroll rate silently collects on the whole wage bill
  *in addition to* the income-tax function, invisibly. PHL: `tau_payroll = 0.14` was collecting a
  hidden 5.8% of GDP on top of a flat 20% ETR. Audit the **combined** household take, decompose it
  yourself (`true payroll = tau_payroll × wL/Y`), and set `frac_tax_payroll = SSC/(SSC+PIT)` so the
  reported split matches the data split. **[PHL]**
- **Standing check — statutory-for-effective on the bequest tax, now a THIRD family instance** (ZAF
  `tau_bq = 0.2` collecting 3.9% of GDP; PHL `tau_bq = 0.06` collecting 1.19% vs actual estate+donor
  collections of ~0.07%). Deductions, exemptions, and non-filing put effective estate taxation one to
  two orders of magnitude below statutory nearly everywhere: always compute `tau_bq` from
  collections ÷ model bequest flows, and grep every new port for this parameter. Check IDN/ETH/BRA.
- **PIT functional form — three paths, in increasing fidelity:**
  1. *Flat `linear`* ("given limited data"): a single ETR + MTR number. Cheapest, no progressivity.
     PHL/IDN/BRA pick the number; only ETH *derives* it (revenue identity). Fine as a first pass.
  2. *Progressive parametric form fit to the statutory schedule* **[ZAF — the best data-poor
     option]**: genuine progressivity with **no microdata** — you only need the country's statutory
     PIT schedule plus a collections target. Strongly prefer this over flat-linear whenever a
     statutory schedule exists (i.e. almost always). **Default to the GS (Gouveia-Strauss) form, not
     HSV.** GS floors the ETR at exactly zero — faithful wherever a statutory threshold + rebates
     exempt the bottom (most schedules), and numerically robust. HSV's ETR goes *negative* below the
     threshold, and that implicit bottom-end subsidy is **not cosmetic: on ZAF it drained transition
     revenue and helped push the TPI into a debt runaway, where GS with the same targets converged.**
     Recipe below.
  3. *Microdata-estimated nonlinear* (OG-USA via Tax-Calculator): a 12-parameter form fit by
     age×year to microsimulated ETR/MTR. Only feasible with a Tax-Calculator-equivalent + filer
     microdata.
- **Progressive-fit recipe (verified against ogcore `txfunc.py`).** Both forms calibrate the same
  way — the statutory schedule pins the *shape*, the collections target pins the *level* — and both
  use the *same* parameter triple/pair for `etr_params`, `mtrx_params`, `mtry_params` (analytically
  consistent; mtrx = mtry, the total-income MTR):
  - **GS** (`tax_func_type = "GS"`, params `(φ0, φ1, φ2)`): tax `T(y) = φ0·(y − (y^−φ1 + φ2)^(−1/φ1))`
    on total income. ETR = 0 exactly at the bottom and asymptotes to `φ0` at the top — so set
    **`φ0` = the statutory top marginal rate** (an anchor, not a fit), fit **`φ1`** (curvature) to the
    schedule's shape, and tune **`φ2`** (scale) in-model to the PIT/GDP collections target — the
    effective-rate/informality wedge enters here, pulling the level down to actual collections.
    (ZAF: `[0.464, 1.39288, 1.43e-8]` → PIT 10.1% of GDP, top MTR 45%. PHL: `[0.35, 1.196, 1.9e-8]`
    → PIT 3.12% of GDP.) Tuning mechanics **[PHL]**: the revenue response to `φ2` is **concave** —
    top incomes sit in the saturated region where ETR ≈ φ0 regardless of φ2, so halving φ2 cuts
    revenue by less than half; expect 2–3 in-model iterations, not one proportional step. Lowering
    φ2 for informality acts like shifting the schedule toward higher incomes — the right shape for
    "most earners effectively untaxed". And GS's smoothing means the sub-threshold ETR is *near*
    zero, not zero (PHL: ~1.2% at 80% of the exempt threshold) — accept it; it is the price of never
    going negative like HSV, and pin it in a test as a bound, not an equality. Incomes are evaluated
    in currency units via `factor` (`mean_income_data`), so φ2 carries units `income^(−φ1)`.
  - **HSV** (`tax_func_type = "HSV"`, `λ = coef0`, `τ = coef1`): `ETR = 1 − λ·y^(−τ)`,
    `MTR = 1 − λ(1−τ)·y^(−τ)`. τ (progressivity) is scale-invariant — fit it to the schedule's shape;
    λ absorbs the income scale — tune it to collections. (ZAF's HSV fit: τ≈0.14 tracked SARS — before
    the GS switch.) **Use only where a bottom-end subsidy is harmless:** below the tax threshold HSV's
    ETR goes negative, and in a tightly-balanced fiscal block that subsidy bleeds transition revenue —
    it contributed to a TPI debt runaway on ZAF. If the budget has no slack, use GS.
- **Informality — the maturity ladder** (choose the rung the data supports):
  1. *Narrative only* **[BRA]**: name informality as the reason effective ≪ statutory, pick a stylized
     flat rate, flag as provisional. No mechanism.
  2. *Structural 2-sector demo* **[IDN, "Option B"]**: use OG-Core's multi-industry `M`/`I` machinery —
     an informal industry with `cit_rate=0`, `tau_c=0`, lower capital intensity, its own `alpha_c`
     share. Illustrative/tutorial, not revenue-anchored.
  3. *Household graded non-compliance* **[ETH, "Option A", fullest]**: `labor_/capital_income_tax_
     noncompliance_rate[t,j]` and `income_tax_filer[t,j]` grade compliance by lifetime-income group
     (a proxy for formality — informal employment share → how many bottom groups get noncompliance=1),
     with the compliant-group ETR **solved from a revenue identity** and the MTR set to the statutory
     top rate. Informality = non-*remittance*, not non-*filing* (filer stays 1). If you later add an
     informal *industry* (Option B), migrate the firm-side informality out of the CIT factor to avoid
     double-counting.
- **OG-Core structural facts (guardrails):**
  - `etr_params`/`mtrx_params`/`mtry_params` vary by **(t, age s)** only — **not** by ability type j.
    Group heterogeneity enters only through each household's income arguments.
  - `noncompliance`/`income_tax_filer` vary by **(t, j)** — not by age.
  - **`mtrx_params` = marginal rate on LABOR income; `mtry_params` = marginal rate on CAPITAL income.**
    The `x`/`y` naming is non-mnemonic — any doc/skill that says "mtrx = capital" is wrong. (ETH's
    taxes.md had this reversed; it was fixed.)
- **Known OG-Core bugs in the compliance machinery** (from the ETH informality work):
  - *SS diagnostic*: `SS.py` tiles the capital-noncompliance array from the labor rate for the
    post-solve `mtry_ss` diagnostic (doesn't affect the solution). Keep labor = capital noncompliance
    and it never bites.
  - *TPI path*: `TPI.py` applies **year-0** compliance/filer values to the whole path's revenue
    accounting, so any **time-varying** compliance reform yields inconsistent transition revenue
    (behavior responds, revenue doesn't). Steady states are fine; a formalization *reform* needs the
    upstream fix. Symptom: reform revenue tracks the baseline exactly while labor supply moves.
- **Capturing non-tax and residual-tax revenue (the "unmodeled ~4% of GDP") [PHL — net-new,
  replicate everywhere]:** OG-Core has no "other revenue" parameter, but leaving recurring non-tax
  revenue and residual taxes out understates government resources and — through the budget identity —
  forces model spending correspondingly too low. Map each stream to the instrument that prices the
  same economic margin, then tune in-model to collections:
  - *Property-type taxes* (recurrent property tax, transaction/stamp duties, local levies — the
    OECD "other taxes" residual) → the **wealth tax**: `h_wealth = 1`, `m_wealth` small-but-positive
    (`m = 0` divides 0/0 at `b = 0`; `0.001` works) makes `ETR_wealth ≈ p_wealth` flat, zero at zero
    wealth, MTR → `p_wealth`. A recurrent property tax IS a flat tax on a form of wealth, so the
    distortion lands on the correct margin (saving). PHL: `p_wealth = 0.0035` ⇒ 1.32% of GDP.
  - *Government capital income* (SOE/central-bank dividends, state gaming shares, guarantee fees,
    treasury interest income) + *unallocable income taxes* (final withholding on deposits etc.) →
    the **CIT adjustment factor** — both are government takes from capital income.
  - *Fees and charges* (user payments for services) → **`tau_c`**.
  Discipline: use only *recurring* flows — treasuries book one-offs (fund-balance transfers,
  privatization, concession fees) in non-tax revenue and often flag them themselves; exclude them.
  Two OECD-accounting traps: estate/donor taxes sit *inside* the "other taxes" residual (net them
  out or they double-count against `tau_bq`), and the income-tax *total* usually exceeds PIT + CIT —
  the difference is the unallocable withholding, real revenue that belongs on the capital side.
- **Statutory-for-effective errors bias REFORMS, not just levels [PHL]:** a CIT cut's simulated
  effect **doubled** once the adjustment factor carried true collections — the statutory rate change
  maps to a larger effective-rate change on a properly-scaled base. A calibration that over- or
  under-states an instrument's effective rate mis-sizes every reform running through it.
- **Watch for doc/code drift:** e.g. OG-IDN's `taxes.md` rates are stale vs. its shipped JSON.

## Fiscal consistency — using fiscal data to dial in the calibration

**The single most destabilizing calibration error is a government budget that does not balance at the
debt target.** The spending ratios (`alpha_G`, `alpha_T`), the revenue the tax system actually
raises, and `debt_ratio_ss` are three independently-set knobs that MUST satisfy one identity, or the
model's transition blows up. **[net-new: ZAF, proven by TPI sims]**

- **The identity.** For debt to hold at `debt_ratio_ss` in the steady state, the government must run a
  primary balance `pb* = (r_gov − g)/(1 + g) · debt_ratio_ss`, where `g = e^{g_y}(1 + g_n_ss) − 1`
  (the model's real, detrended growth) and `r_gov` is the SS real sovereign rate. So **primary
  spending must equal revenue − pb\*** — and primary spending includes public investment:
  `alpha_G + alpha_T + alpha_I ≈ Σ(revenue)/Y − pb*` (forgetting `alpha_I ≈ 0.05` mis-sets `alpha_G`
  by 5pp of GDP). Set the spending side to this, don't inherit it. With `r_gov < g` (common for EMs
  after an honest `r_gov` re-anchor), `pb*` is *negative* — the country stabilizes debt while running
  primary deficits, which usually matches its actual fiscal history. **Frame the residual honestly:**
  after capturing all recurring revenue, the remaining gap between model `G/Y` and observed
  government consumption should be ≈ (actual primary balance − pb*) — the country's genuine
  consolidation distance — plus measurement differences; name it in the docs as what the stable-debt
  SS deliberately embeds. (PHL: actual pb −2.8% vs pb* −0.7% ⇒ ~2pp embedded consolidation.) **[ZAF;
  identity-with-`alpha_I` and the consolidation-gap framing: PHL]**
- **Why it bites the transition, not the SS.** OG-Core's SS closure silently forces spending to the
  consistent level to hit the debt target, so the **steady state always solves and looks fine**. But
  the *transition* holds `alpha_G + alpha_T` at their input values for the first `tG1` periods before
  the closure adjusts — so if the input spending exceeds the consistent level, debt balloons over the
  transition before the closure violently corrects it. **With a debt-elastic premium on, that
  overshoot feeds the convex premium and the TPI runs away** (debt → ∞). Symptom: SS solves, baseline
  transition diverges or overshoots wildly. Damping and better solvers (even Anderson) do NOT fix it —
  it is a genuine fiscal runaway, not a convergence artifact.
- **Over-collecting taxes MASK the inconsistency — audit revenue by instrument.** A flat/placeholder
  tax rate set too high, or a spurious leftover tax parameter, inflates revenue and accidentally
  balances an over-set spending side; the model then looks stable until you fix the tax. Two real ZAF
  examples that hid a ~3%-of-GDP spending>revenue gap: a **flat PIT collecting ~16% of GDP** when the
  country's actual PIT is ~10% (a flat rate applied to everyone over-collects vs a progressive
  schedule), and a **spurious `tau_bq = 0.2`** (20% bequest tax) collecting 3.9% of GDP when the
  country has negligible estate duty *and the docs said bequest tax was zero* (doc/JSON drift). Check
  every revenue line against the country's actual collections **by instrument** (PIT, CIT, VAT +
  fuel/excise/customs — `tau_c` should capture ALL consumption/indirect taxes, not VAT alone —
  payroll, bequest, wealth), and grep the JSON for nonzero taxes the docs claim are off.
- **Progressive taxes expose what flat taxes hide.** A flat rate raises revenue proportionally to
  income and is robust along the transition; a progressive schedule's revenue is far more sensitive,
  so a spending>revenue gap a flat tax papered over will destabilize the transition once you switch to
  a progressive (GS/HSV) form. Don't blame the progressive form — check the fiscal balance first.
- **Reconcile against the country's OWN fiscal plan, and know what the SS represents.** Pull the
  primary-balance path and debt trajectory from the IMF Article IV / DSA and the national budget. If
  the country actually runs `pb*` (stable/declining debt), the model's SS matches current policy. If
  the country runs a deficit / rising debt (common), the model's stable-debt SS is the country's
  **targeted, post-consolidation** state — set spending to the consistent (lower) level and document
  it as such, rather than matching today's higher actual spending. Also confirm the debt is
  local-currency and rollable (usually low default risk) so you know the stable-debt SS is a modeling
  device, not a solvency claim.
- **A hot interest-growth differential forces spending too low — check `r_gov − g` against data.**
  If the model's real `(r_gov − g)` exceeds the country's actual, `pb*` is inflated and the consistent
  spending drops below the country's real spending. Diagnose both legs: `r_gov` (the LMWW wedge shift
  `μ_d` is a cross-country EM average — check it against the country's *actual* real effective
  borrowing rate = nominal debt-service/gross-debt minus inflation) and `g` (`g_y` set to a stagnant
  realized window understates a country whose debt path assumes medium-term potential growth — the
  SS is a long-run state, so a forward-looking `g_y` can be the honest choice). Bringing `r_gov − g`
  in line with the country lets spending sit at the realistic level. **[net-new: ZAF]**

## Multi-industry (M>1) — the SAM method

Build it as its own builder-regenerated file (packaging choices: mental model item 3): a
`create_multisector_calibration.py` that writes the static JSON, **one** example script
(`run_og_<xxx>_multiple_industry.py`), and shared constants (`TOTAL_CAPITAL_SHARE`,
`PUBLIC_CAPITAL_SHARE`, `CAPITAL_OUTPUT_RATIO`) in one `constants.py` so the builder and the live
Calibration can't drift.

**Finding the SAM — the sourcing hierarchy applies here too; search, don't assume one exists or
doesn't:**
- Search order: (1) the **national statistics office / central bank** — some publish an official SAM,
  and many more publish **supply-and-use tables (SUTs) / IO tables**, which are enough: the make/use
  algebra below runs on them directly (BRA: IBGE SUTs via the Alves-Passoni–Freitas annual IO
  series). (2) **Research institutes that build SAMs with the national authorities** — **UNU-WIDER**
  (country SAM program; ZAF's 2019 SASAM, distributed with a technical note) and **IFPRI** (the
  *Nexus* country-SAM program on the IFPRI Dataverse — standardized ~42-activity SAMs with
  labour-by-education/land/capital factor rows and 10 household groups; PHL's 2018 SAM) are the
  family's two workhorses, free and documented, covering many developing countries. (3) **Global harmonized/modeled databases** only as a last resort, marked
  lower-confidence: GTAP (licensed — one-time tiered fee for the current version, older versions
  free; has factor detail, being a CGE database), EORA (190-country MRIO; free for academic use,
  licensed otherwise), OECD ICIO (free; built from national SUTs but harmonized/balanced). Their
  estimation/balancing steps go beyond the national accounts, and most lack the SAM's full
  household/factor account detail — which is why they rank below a national SUT or an institute SAM.
- **What qualifies:** separate factor rows (labour — ideally disaggregated — and a capital/operating-
  surplus row), household expenditure columns, activity (and possibly commodity) accounts, an
  imports/rest-of-world account, and production-tax rows. Note whether the make is **diagonal or
  rectangular** — it decides the `io_matrix` algebra below. **Match the vintage to the rest of the
  calibration**: the employment survey year must equal the SAM year (ZAF: 2019 SASAM ↔ QLFS 2019),
  and the SAM must reproduce the same-year national accounts (structural validation, below).
- **Delivery: never read the publisher's URL at runtime** — publisher links move and break. Either
  mirror the file in the family's `EAPD-DRB/SAM-files` GitHub repo and read the raw URL (ZAF), or
  ship a compact extract in the package's `data/` (PHL, BRA). Either way record publisher, technical
  note, and year in the reader's docstring and the docs.

**Assert the concordances partition the SAM before anything else:** every activity in exactly one
`PROD_DICT` industry and every commodity in exactly one `CONS_DICT` good — a one-line set-equality
check. ZAF shipped two silently-wrong commodity codes (`colig` for `coilg`, `ccmemb` for `cmemb`)
that just dropped those commodities from every aggregation; the assert catches the whole error class.
**[net-new: ZAF]**

**Defining the industries (`PROD_DICT`) — grouping rules that prevent degenerate capital shares:**
- **Manufacturing / the capital-goods producer goes LAST** (it must be the numeraire — see structural
  facts below).
- **Never let real estate / dwellings stand alone as its own industry [PHL, BRA].** Its measured
  capital share is dominated by *imputed owner-occupier dwelling rent* — booked as operating surplus
  (capital income) but not corporate profit — which pushes its `gamma_m` toward ~1 (degenerate in the
  CES production function) and dilutes its effective CIT (imputed rent isn't taxable profit but sits in
  the denominator). Fold it into a broader **FIRE / finance–business-services** aggregate, as OG-PHL
  and OG-BRA both do. More generally, merge any activity whose surplus is dominated by imputed or
  resource rent (dwellings; watch mining/extractives) rather than modeling it alone — healthy
  capital-intensive sectors (mining, utilities ~0.78 in PHL) solve fine; it's the imputed-rent-driven
  ~0.9+ shares that break things.
- OG-Core has only **two private factors**, so **land/resource rent is folded into capital income** in
  `gamma_m` — a second reason raw SAM capital shares come out biased high (needing the VA-weighted
  rescale) and why rent-dominated activities need grouping.

**The five SAM-derived inputs** (`input_output.py`; OG-PHL is the reference, OG-BRA the most advanced):
0. **`alpha_c`** — household expenditure shares over the I consumption goods, from the SAM's
   **household columns** (purchaser prices — the budget households actually allocate), summing to 1.
   Not the legacy `total − row` shortcut (that's total commodity demand, not household spending).
   Keep the legacy naive `get_io_matrix` in place for the live `Calibration(update_from_api=True)`
   path and its unit tests — the builder uses the value-added version below; both PHL and ZAF follow
   this split.
1. **`gamma_m`** — `(capital+land)/(labor+capital+land)` per industry from SAM factor rows, then
   **rescaled** so the VA-weighted mean equals an independent economy-wide capital share (keeps the
   cross-industry pattern, fixes the level). BRA adds a per-industry mixed-income (Gollin) split first.
2. **`io_matrix`** — the **value-added** version: trace household consumption of each good back through
   the domestic supply chain to value added by industry, weighted by household consumption netted of
   imports, rows renormalized to 1. **Not** the naive direct-intermediate-cell version (a legacy
   baseline that isn't an accounting identity — IDN/ETH still ship only that legacy version). The
   correction is large: household energy spending maps to ~45% electricity in ZAF (~74% in PHL), vs. the
   manufacturing-heavy split a naive direct-use matrix implies. **Match the algebra to the SAM's make
   structure** — this is the error-prone piece: PHL's SAM has a *diagonal* make (one activity per
   commodity), which collapses to `A_d = σ·use/output`, Leontief `(I−A_d)^-1`; but a SAM that separates
   activities from commodities with a **rectangular make** (ZAF's SASAM: 61 activities × 108
   commodities, median commodity produced by >1 activity) needs the full **industry-technology make/use
   algebra** — market-share matrix `D` (`V/g`, allocates each commodity's domestic output to producing
   activities), use coefficients `B` (`U/q`), industry-by-industry Leontief `(I − D·B)^-1`, then VA per
   unit output `v = VA/q`; VA-by-activity `= v·(L @ (D @ f))` for commodity final demand `f`. The
   diagonal shortcut is *wrong* on a rectangular make. Derive `D`/`B`/Leontief from the SAM yourself
   when no pre-computed IO table ships (ZAF), or read them if it does (BRA). Sanity-check with SAM
   balance (`gross output = intermediate + VA + production tax`, machine-precision) and Leontief
   validity (spectral radius of `D·B` < 1) before trusting the result — and watch for a **"total"
   row/column** in the SAM (a 2× inflation tell) that must be excluded.
3. **`L_m` employment** — measured **independently of the SAM** (labor force survey by industry) so
   `Z_m` doesn't collapse into a mechanical function of factor shares. When the survey's industry
   aggregation is coarser than `PROD_DICT` (e.g. QLFS lumps electricity+gas+water into "utilities"),
   split the aggregate by the **SAM's labour-compensation shares** of the sub-activities, not an
   arbitrary or output-based split — a labour-intensive sub-industry (waste/sanitation) employs more per
   rand of output than a capital-intensive one (power generation). A too-low headcount in a small
   sub-industry produces a wild TFP outlier (ZAF Water&Waste `Z` fell 5.3→3.5 once split by labour
   compensation instead of a guessed 77/23).
4. **`Z_m` sector TFP** — Solow residual `Y_m/(K_m^γm · Kg^γg · L_m^(1−γm−γg))`, normalized so the
   **numeraire (last) industry = 1**. `K_m` allocates a national stock (PWT capital-output ratio ×
   total VA) across industries by capital-income share; the ratio's *level* is a weak lever (with the
   numeraire normalization it enters relative Z only through the γ dispersion) — take it from the PWT
   and move on. Reject establishment-survey capital (omits informal capital, inverts the ranking).

**OG-Core structural facts:**
- The **last industry (index M−1) is the numeraire and the only non-consumption producer** — all
  investment, government, net-outflow, remittance, and aid demand loads on it, so its nominal output
  share is inflated and is *never* comparable to a value-added share. **Put the capital-goods /
  manufacturing industry LAST** in `PROD_DICT`.
- **One economy-wide wage; households don't choose a sector** (`L_m` is firm-side labor demand). A
  formal/informal wage gap or sector-choice margin is *not* representable without extending OG-Core.
- `cit_rate`/`tau_c`/`delta_tau`/`inv_tax_credit` **can** vary by industry/good; wage and household
  labor supply cannot.
- The composite-consumption price is **unnormalized**, carrying a units constant `k =
  prod_i(alpha_c_i^−alpha_c_i)` (=1 when I=1) — behaviorally relevant, not cosmetic.

**Single ↔ multi compatibility** (so the two representations agree):
- **Copy economy-wide values verbatim** (demographics, preferences, fiscal ratios, open-economy dials,
  `g_y`, statutory rates) — any difference is a bug.
- `gamma_m`: keep the SAM's dispersion, **impose the single model's level** (VA-weighted mean).
- `Z`: relative TFPs from the Solow residual with numeraire = 1. **Two distinct uses of the Z *level*
  (a common Hicks-neutral rescale) — don't conflate them:** (a) to close *rate/ratio* gaps (r, K_f/K)
  it is a weak, sometimes wrong-signed lever — don't (PHL: an 11.7% Z rise moved r the *wrong* way);
  (b) to align the *income level* (`factor`) it is the correct, clean lever — r, r_gov and K/Y are
  invariant to it, only the income level moves. The numeraire=1 convention pins relative TFPs but leaves
  the level free, and whether it *happens* to land `factor` on the single's is luck (PHL: −0.02%, no
  rescale; ZAF: −23%, needed one). So: if `factor` is still off after the chi conversion, rescale the
  **whole Z vector by a common constant** (a quick log-log root-find on solved-SS `factor` converges in
  2–3 solves; β≈1.8 for ZAF) so the multi's factor matches the single's. `factor` *must* agree — it
  scales the incomes at which the (progressive) tax functions are evaluated, so a 23% factor gap
  mis-collects PIT.
- **The `chi_n`/`chi_b` units conversion is THE alignment lever:** scale both by `k^(σ−1)`, derived
  (not fitted) from FOC-invariance under the composite-consumption units change. In PHL this closed
  44–80% of the r / K_f/K / B/Y / K/Y gaps.
- **Solver seeds are the single-industry model's — never separately tune seeds for the multi.** Lean
  overlay: don't copy them in (inherit from the base at load). Self-sufficient file: the builder's
  merge copies them verbatim and regeneration keeps them synced. Either way the multi cold-starts from
  the single's seeds — which works because the multi's flat anchor *is* the shared aggregate economy.
- **Final acceptance: run the SAME reform through both models** and compare the percent-change tables —
  same signs, similar magnitudes (ZAF: CIT 27→30% through M=1 and M=8; all six aggregates agreed).
- **Comparison dashboard:** must-match (D/Y, tax rates); close (K/Y, `factor` — a big factor gap means
  a level misalignment upstream); ballpark with a written reason (r, K_f/K, B/Y); never compare raw
  (Y/w/C levels, raw C/Y in multi — use `p_tilde·C/Y`, the numeraire's nominal share).

**The continuation solve** (a fallback for when the calibrated multi-industry SS won't solve cold —
OG-Core seeds every industry price at 1). **Try the direct solve first:** ZAF's M=8 converged cold from
the shared base-JSON seeds in ~130s (the flat anchor ≈ the single economy, so the single's seeds are
close), so reach for continuation only if the direct solve fails:
1. Solve a **flat anchor**: all `gamma = economy-wide mean`, `Z = 1`.
2. Walk `t: 0→1`, morphing `gamma(t)` and `Z(t)` **together** to the calibrated values, each step a
   warm-started reform off the previous; grow the step on success, halve on failure.
3. Use **heavier TPI damping, `TPI_NU ≈ 0.2`** (the default 0.4 oscillates; 0.3 is marginal). ogcore
   ≥0.16.4 adds opt-in Anderson acceleration (`TPI_outer_method="anderson"`) as a further lever for
   stiff multi-industry TPI — but remember neither damping nor Anderson fixes a *fiscal* runaway
   (see Fiscal consistency); solver knobs treat oscillation, not an unbalanced budget.
4. Reuse the continuation's converged SS for the baseline TPI (hand-place the pickle) — only the
   reform re-solves its own SS.

**Maturity honesty:** OG-PHL is the reference (the complete version, with the chi conversion, lives on
PR EAPD-DRB/OG-PHL#63's branch, not `main`); OG-BRA is the most advanced port; **OG-ZAF has now
executed the full SAM-Solow method** (make/use-Leontief value-added `io_matrix`, VA-mean-rescaled
`gamma`, Solow-residual `Z` with QLFS employment, the chi conversion, and a factor-aligning Z-level
rescale — a self-sufficient JSON regenerated by `create_multisector_calibration.py`; PR
EAPD-DRB/OG-ZAF#142). OG-IDN and OG-ETH have **not** — their shipped multisector JSONs are partial or
placeholder (OG-IDN even ships the flat *anchor* gamma/Z as if calibrated). Don't treat a sibling's
multisector JSON as a worked example without checking `input_output.py` has the real
`get_gamma`/`get_Z`/value-added `get_io_matrix` functions.

## Validation — test the joint steady state

### Transition-path validation against the fiscal program [PHL — net-new, replicate everywhere]

The SS dashboard can't see timing. After the steady state validates, compare the **baseline TPI
paths** of the fiscal variables against the country's own published program — the sharpest test of
whether the calibration tracks *expected* reality:

- **The comparison set** (model from `TPI_vars.pkl`, first ~10–15 years): primary balance
  (`total_tax_revenue − total_primary_government_outlays`)/Y vs the treasury's actual primary
  balance + the medium-term program's (deficit path less programmed interest); `D/Y` vs actual debt
  ratios + the program's trajectory/targets; total revenue/Y vs the program's revenue effort **with
  a stated concept bridge** (model revenue is general-government accrual + captured non-tax; NG cash
  programs need a wedge — derive it from one overlap year of OECD-vs-treasury data and hold it
  constant); `I_g/Y` vs the program's infrastructure path. Sources: the MTFF-class medium-term
  fiscal framework (deficit/revenue/disbursement/infra paths), the budget document (interest
  projections, to convert deficit→primary), treasury cash-operations reports (actuals).
- **The alpha_G glide — put the transition on the government's consolidation schedule.** A flat
  identity-value `alpha_G` makes the model consolidate *immediately* (pb jumps to pb* in year one,
  typically years ahead of the actual plan), which pays debt far below target early (PHL: down to
  ~48% vs a 58–61% program band) before the closure brings it back. Instead set `alpha_G` as a
  declining path: `alpha_G(t) = SS_revenue_share − pb_program(t) − alpha_T − alpha_I(t)` for each
  program year, **capped at the identity-consistent value from the year the program's primary
  balance crosses the model's pb*** (don't chase extended-projection years tighter than pb* — that
  re-introduces the undershoot). The SS is untouched (the closure ignores `alpha_G`); only the
  transition's stance changes. Bonus validation: if the program's own consolidation converges to
  pb* near the end of the program window, the steady state is literally where the government's plan
  is headed — say so in the docs.
- **A violent early-transition spike is a diagnosis, not a feature.** A one-to-two year consumption
  / consumption-tax-revenue pulse at the start of the baseline is the fingerprint of the imposed
  initial-wealth condition (see the `initial_wealth_ratio` row in the macro table) — check the
  B_ss/B0 scale factor and fix it with the parameter BEFORE labeling anything benign. (An earlier
  version of this skill advised documenting the spike as "transition dynamics"; that normalized a
  fixable artifact.) The dynamics that legitimately remain after the fix: convergence from a
  non-stationary initial age distribution and capital stock, and — under a fiscal glide — the
  early-transition growth rate exceeding its long-run value, which erodes the debt ratio before the
  arithmetic tightens. Never tune fiscal parameters against whatever residual is left.
- **Deliverable:** a small multi-panel figure (debt ratio, primary balance, revenue, public
  investment; model line vs actual dots vs program markers) committed to the docs images with a
  caption naming every source, referenced from the macro chapter's validation section — and axis
  limits that show the model's full path (clipping the divergence you're testing for defeats the
  exercise).

- **Build a steady-state validation dashboard [emerging: IDN, ETH — adopt it].** A table in `macro.md`
  comparing the solved SS to country data targets, each with a source column. Recurring moments: `D/Y`,
  `D_f/D`, `K_f/K`, `K_f/Y`, `C/Y`, `(I+I_g)/Y`, `K/Y`, `I_g/Y`, `TR/Y`, `NX/Y`, `RM/Y`, `r`, PIT/Y,
  CIT/Y, `T/Y`. The governing sentence: *"most parameters are only weakly identified on their own, so
  the real test is whether the steady state they jointly produce resembles the economy."*
- **Revenue by instrument:** don't just check total tax/GDP — check PIT, CIT, VAT, payroll each against
  collections. Offsetting errors can make the total look right while the composition is wrong.
- **Source the data side by actively searching for the most authoritative source that exists — never
  fill the dashboard from memory, and never treat any source list (including this one) as closed.**
  A wrong data anchor silently fails an otherwise-correct calibration, so treat the data column as
  carefully as the model column. For each moment, search in descending order of authority and stop at
  the highest rung that has the number:
  1. **The official national institution that *owns* the number** — the agency that administers it:
     revenue service for collections, treasury/finance ministry (budget review, fiscal framework,
     debt bulletin) for spending/debt/debt-service, statistics office for GDP-by-industry / HFCE /
     the labour force survey, central bank (quarterly bulletin, IIP) for external and monetary data.
     Institution *names* differ by country — search by **role** ("who administers this number
     here?"), and expect to find ministries, debt-management offices, planning commissions, or
     social-security agencies you didn't know existed. Their publications outrank everything else.
  2. **Official international compilations of national data** — IMF (Article IV statistical
     appendix, GFS, WEO), World Bank, UN, ILO, PWT — often the same national numbers, re-published
     with a lag and on standardized definitions (useful for cross-checks, weaker on vintage). For
     the whole revenue side, the **OECD Revenue Statistics country note** (Asia-Pacific / LAC /
     Africa editions, free 4-page PDFs) is the single best table in the family's experience **[PHL]**:
     every instrument as % of GDP on one accrual basis and one GDP vintage — PIT, CIT, SSC, VAT,
     excises, customs, and an "other taxes" residual. Pair it with the treasury's cash-operations
     report for non-tax revenue, interest payments, and the actual primary balance.
  3. **Regional development banks and bodies** — AfDB/ADB/IADB/EBRD country diagnostics, regional
     statistical commissions — frequently carry country detail (sector data, informality, fiscal
     risk) that neither the national site nor the IMF publishes cleanly.
  Typical role→moment map to start from: tax ratios ← revenue service *tax statistics* + budget
  review; debt / foreign-share / effective `r_gov` (= debt-service ÷ gross debt, deflated) ← budget
  review / debt office; sector value-added shares ← GDP-by-industry release; household consumption
  shares ← HFCE / expenditure survey / CPI weights; employment by industry ← labour force survey;
  `K/Y` ← PWT. Adversarially re-check the load-bearing numbers against a second, independent source.
  When the search genuinely comes up empty at every rung, use the best lower-rung number, note the
  vintage, and mark the moment lower-confidence rather than dropping it from the dashboard.
- **Mind the GDP vintage — the silent ratio trap.** When the statistics office *rebases* GDP, every
  `x/GDP` ratio moves without anything real changing (South Africa's 2021 rebasing shifted tax-to-GDP
  ~2.6 pp: 23.7% on the rebased base vs 26.3% on the old base, *same year*). Compare a model ratio to a
  data ratio on **one consistent GDP vintage**, and say which — a calibration tuned to an old-vintage
  ratio will look ~2–3 pp off against current data for no real reason.
- **Read the model side from the solved SS object** (`safe_read_pickle` on `SS_vars.pkl`), don't
  eyeball it: fiscal ratios are revenue lines over `Y` — PIT `iit_revenue/Y`, CIT
  `business_tax_revenue/Y`, indirect `cons_tax_revenue/Y`, total `total_tax_revenue/Y`; `D/Y`, `D_f/D`,
  `K/Y` from the aggregates over `Y`; `r`, `r_gov`, `factor` directly; consumption share as
  `p_tilde·C/Y` (never raw `C/Y` when `I>1`).
- **Structural validation (multi-industry) — check the SAM reproduces the national accounts before
  trusting it.** The SAM's value-added shares by broad sector should track the statistics office's
  GDP-by-industry (a 2019 SA SAM matched Stats SA to ~0.5 pp on primary/secondary/tertiary); employment
  shares should match the LFS (they are the source); `alpha_c` should match HFCE's goods/services
  split. A SAM that doesn't reproduce the national accounts' sector structure is the wrong vintage or
  mis-aggregated — fix that before reading anything else off the multi-industry SS.
- **Note derived quantities honestly:** e.g. "net exports" is a balance-of-payments *residual* of the
  resource constraint (OG-Core has no trade sector), not a modeled export/import.
- **Know the family traits before "fixing" them:** the model's endogenous `K/Y` runs high against the
  PWT across the whole family (ZAF 4.5 vs 3.7; PHL 4.3) — a structural feature of the saving/return
  block, not a country-calibration error. Report it with a written reason in the dashboard's ballpark
  tier; don't distort a country parameter to chase it.
- **Fast value-pinning test [emerging: ETH — adopt it].** A `test_default_parameters.py` that loads the
  shipped JSON and pins specific calibrated values with inline source citations, explicitly *not*
  asserting anything that needs a solve. Separate this from the slow example smoke test.
- **Prevent doc/JSON drift with `{glue:text}` [emerging: ETH — adopt it].** A hidden code-cell in the
  docs loads the packaged JSON and `glue()`s the numbers, so prose can never drift from the shipped
  values.
- **The in-model tuning loop is cheap — use real solves, not algebra [PHL].** A warm-guess SS solve
  is ~15s (single worker, no dask), so the workflow *solve → read revenue dashboard → adjust dials →
  re-solve* converges in 3–5 iterations for half a dozen simultaneous dials (GS φ2, `tau_c`, CIT
  adjustment, `p_wealth`, `r_gov_shift`, `zeta_K`). Keep a driver script that loads the packaged
  JSON + an overrides dict, solves SS-only, and prints model-vs-target by instrument. Always finish
  with a **standalone solve of the packaged JSON itself** (no overrides) — it catches schema errors
  and guess problems the overrides path hides.
- **Run engineering: SS serial, TPI parallel with Anderson [PHL — adopt everywhere].** The dask
  client's distribution overhead DOMINATES the SS solve (PHL: 12+ min through a 7-worker client vs
  66s with `client=None`) while the TPI genuinely benefits from j-parallelism. And
  `TPI_outer_method = "anderson"` (ogcore ≥0.16.4) cut the M=1 transition from ~30–70 damped
  iterations (~20 min) to 11–12 (~2–2.5 min) with monotonically declining distances — put it in the
  packaged JSON, not just the multi-industry overlay. Watch the distance series the first time: if
  it oscillates or stalls, fall back to damped `nu`. `ogcore.execute.runner` always re-solves the
  SS, so a two-phase driver (SS.run_SS with client=None → pickle → TPI.run_TPI with the client)
  is the fast pattern.
- **Verify BOTH tails of every path, and read the figure you just made [PHL — a caught error].** A
  min-only check on the debt path ("trough = 60.0, stays on target") passed while the path actually
  climbed to 74% — the check tested only the direction the PREVIOUS failure pointed. For every path
  claim report min AND max with their years, and eyeball the plotted line before writing the
  sentence about it.
- **Running a country model against an unreleased ogcore branch [PHL].** `uv run --with-editable
  <ogcore-checkout>` can silently resolve ogcore from the uv CACHE, and probing with `python -c`
  from the checkout root masks it via cwd shadowing. The working pattern: run from the ogcore
  checkout's env with the country repo overlaid (`cd OG-Core && uv run --with-editable ../OG-XXX
  python driver.py`), pin `sys.path.insert(0, <ogcore-checkout>)` in the driver, and `assert
  <checkout> in ogcore.__file__` before anything else — the assert has caught real contamination.
  Keep the packaged JSON loadable on RELEASED ogcore too: tests that build a `Specifications`
  strip not-yet-released parameters when absent (`hasattr` guard), so the suite stays green on
  both.
- **Initial-guess fragility: nearness ≠ solvability [PHL].** Guesses retuned to the *exact* solved
  values (factor to 5 digits) sent the solver through a `K_d < 0` region and failed the SS, while
  older, farther guesses converged cleanly. Choose packaged guesses by solve-path robustness — keep
  the set that works, don't chase proximity. Relatedly, transient `"K_d has negative elements"`
  warnings during iteration are benign **iff** the identities hold in the saved pickle
  (`K = K_d + K_f`, `K_d = B − D_d`) — check the pickle, not the console.
- **Derived parameters regenerate together [PHL].** Anything computed *from* demographics —
  the model-consistent `g_RM` path (from `g_n`), the `eta_RM` matrix (from `omega_SS`) — belongs in
  the demographics-regeneration tool so a demographics rebuild can't leave it stale, with a test
  asserting packaged value == constructor(packaged inputs).

## House rules (lift verbatim into any port)

- **uv only, run as a user would.** Don't hand-pick a Python; let uv resolve Python + ogcore.
- **Never commit a `uv.lock` change** from calibration work; keep it out of the PR diff.
- **Non-destructive:** the single-industry default must keep working; ship multi-industry as its own
  builder-regenerated file (lean overlay or self-sufficient — see the packaging choices in the mental
  model), never by editing the single-industry JSON.
- **Document every calibrated value with a source** — even stylized placeholders (family norm; a few
  repos' tax docs still lack inline citations — add them when you touch those docs).
- **Ask before push, ask before PR — never in the same step.** PR style: narrative, plain language,
  explain the *why*, push detail to the docs; a changed-parameters table + a steady-state-lands table +
  an example macro-results table.
- **Family approval gates apply** (the OG family README): calibrate, edit, and commit locally
  freely — but launching solves beyond a quick SS check, pushing, PR-opening, and anything
  fleet-scale are proposed and wait for the user's explicit call. Never merge.

### Preparing the calibration PR — what maintainers actually ask for [PHL #63 review, jdebacker]

- **Register: the PR reports what was done; the docs carry the discussion.** State each change and
  its anchor in a line or two ("unmodeled recurring revenue is carried by the nearest-equivalent
  instruments: property-type taxes on the wealth tax, state-asset income on the CIT adjustment, fees
  on `tau_c`") and point to the calibration chapter for the derivation, the alternatives, and the
  caveats. Design-justification paragraphs ("worth review", "the honest carrier", why-not-X) belong
  in the PR **only when explicitly asking the maintainers to decide something** — otherwise they
  read as asking for a debate nobody requested. **[PHL #85 feedback]**
- **Always include the goodness-of-fit table** — the standard close for any calibration PR: every
  calibrated moment, `Model | Target | Source`, one row per anchor, revenue lines first, then the
  external/fiscal anchors. Read the model column from the solved SS pickle, never from memory:

  | Moment | Model | Target | Source |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | PIT/Y … each revenue instrument … | | | collections source (e.g. OECD RevStats) |
  | total revenue/Y | | | |
  | RM/Y, K_f/K, D/Y, D_f/D, r_gov | | | BSP/BTr-class anchors |

  Follow it with the tested block (suite count, SS RC error, TPI RC error vs tolerance, debt-path
  behavior vs target) and the reform percent-change table (Y/C/K/L/r/w by year + SS), the same
  format across the family (see PHL #68/#85).

- **Show the before/after of every calibrated object the PR changes — upfront, don't make them ask.**
  On PHL #63 the maintainer's first request was a *new-vs-old side-by-side of the `io_matrix`*. For each
  changed array/matrix (`io_matrix`, `gamma`, `Z`, tax params), put an old→new table in the PR (or a
  reply thread) with the largest shifts called out and explained *by mechanism* — e.g. household energy
  spending moving off manufacturing onto electricity (54%→4% / 11%→74%) because the value-added method
  traces demand to the industry that makes it, not to the numeraire. The diff of a packaged JSON is
  unreadable; the side-by-side is how a reviewer verifies the change does what you claim.
- **Pre-empt the `gamma_g` question.** The maintainer flagged that the SAM books all non-labor income as
  capital with no public-capital attribution, so subtracting `gamma_g` implicitly from *labor* is wrong.
  State the construction explicitly: rescale the SAM's total capital shares to the economy-wide total,
  then subtract `gamma_g` so public capital comes out of *capital* (the SAM measures labor's share
  well). If `gamma_g = 0` (e.g. ZAF), say so — private = total, no carve-out — so the reviewer needn't
  raise it.
- **PR-explanation visuals are not docs visuals.** The maintainer asked that a figure's "what's changing
  in this PR" annotation (a dashed old-vs-new line) be *removed from the version committed to the docs*.
  Keep delta/before-after annotations in the PR conversation; the docs figure shows the calibrated state
  cleanly, because the docs describe the calibration as it *is*, not the PR's delta.
- **Explain derived mechanical corrections in plain language a non-specialist can follow.** A non-obvious
  fix (the chi/`p_tilde` units conversion; a Z-level factor rescale) needs: what was off, the arithmetic
  that causes it, and that the constant is *derived, not fitted*. Same for version-driven fixes — if an
  ogcore bump broke the example and you regenerated demographics/params to fix it, say so and give the
  before/after residual-constraint numbers.

## End-to-end sequence for a new country

*Mechanics used throughout:* solve/run via `uv run python examples/run_og_<xxx>.py` (baseline +
reform + output tables); the earnings tilt is solved inside `income.py`'s
`get_e_interp(gini_to_match=...)`; and dashboard moments are read from the solved output objects with
`ogcore.utils.safe_read_pickle` on `.../OUTPUT_BASELINE/SS/SS_vars.pkl`, `.../TPI/TPI_vars.pkl`, and
`model_params.pkl` (then form ratios like `K_f/Y`, `C/Y`, revenue/GDP).

1. Bootstrap from the closest sibling repo; **immediately fix the copied `country_id`, package name,
   and `egg-info`** (the #1 copy-paste regression).
2. Environment: `uv sync --extra dev`; confirm the resolved ogcore in `uv.lock` matches the EAPD
   siblings; run the preflight.
3. Demographics: set `country_id` (named constant) + add the regression test; solve, check SS
   population growth is sane.
4. Earnings: set the country's earnings-concept Gini (WID, matching the US reference concept); solve
   the tilt scalar.
5. Macro block: debt (initial measured, SS anchored), `zeta_K` (Chinn-Ito prior, tuned to the IIP
   foreign-capital level — re-validate after step 7), world rate (open vs distressed fork), `g_y`
   window (named constants), remittances if material (personal measure; model-consistent `g_RM`
   path; `eta_RM` from survey concentration) / aid, `r_gov` re-anchored to the treasury's effective
   real rate, the centered debt-elastic premium, `initial_Kg_ratio` if `gamma_g > 0`.
6. Capital share: `1 − labor_share`, Gollin-adjusted if agrarian/informal; **remove gamma from the
   live-API path** so it can't be clobbered.
7. Taxes — anchor to the OECD Revenue Statistics country note by instrument: for PIT, prefer a
   **progressive form fit to the statutory schedule** over a flat rate whenever a schedule exists —
   **GS by default** (φ0 = statutory top rate, φ1 to the shape, φ2 to collections; floors ETR at 0);
   take VAT/CIT/payroll/bequest as effective rates from collections (payroll is *additive* to the
   ETR function — audit the combined take; bequest effective is typically 1–2 orders below
   statutory); capture recurring non-tax and property-type revenue on the nearest-margin instruments
   (wealth tax / CIT adjustment / `tau_c`); close the budget identity
   (`alpha_G = revenue − pb* − alpha_T − alpha_I`); pick the informality rung the data supports.
8. `chi_n`: leave at the US values but **document it as uncalibrated**, or re-tilt to an hours target.
9. Validate: build the steady-state dashboard; check revenue by instrument; add the value-pinning test.
10. (Optional) Multi-industry: source the SAM (national SUTs → UNU-WIDER/IFPRI → modeled databases;
    vintage matched to the LFS year); assert the concordances partition it; build the 5 SAM inputs,
    numeraire industry last; try the direct solve first (`nu≈0.2`; continuation only as fallback);
    apply the chi units conversion, then a Z-level rescale if `factor` is still off; verify
    single↔multi agreement via the comparison dashboard and the same-reform acceptance test.
11. Wrap up: `make format`, `pytest -m 'not local'`, CHANGELOG entry (before→after + citation), docs
    with glue-from-JSON. Ask before pushing; ask before the PR.
