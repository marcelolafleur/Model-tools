# skills/

Skills that package instructions for a repeatable task (e.g. the OG country
calibration skill). One directory per skill, each with its own `SKILL.md`.

## Installing a skill

Copy the skill's directory into your Claude skills folder, then restart Claude
Code (or reload the window) so it's picked up:

- **Personal** (available in every project): `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Project** (shared via a repo): `<repo>/.claude/skills/`

For example, to install `og-country-calibration` for your own use:

```
cp -r skills/og/og-country-calibration ~/.claude/skills/
```

Claude discovers it by the `name` and `description` in the `SKILL.md`
frontmatter — no other registration needed. Codex users can copy the same
directory into their configured Codex skills folder; skills that include
`agents/openai.yaml` also expose Codex interface metadata.

## Available skills

- [`add-fisheries-sector`](add-fisheries-sector/SKILL.md): build a complete,
  source-traceable, non-forcing Fisheries sector in an existing solved country
  model.
- [`add-environmental-accounting`](add-environmental-accounting/SKILL.md): add
  auditable water and land accounting to a CLEWS model.
- [`assess-clews-calibration`](assess-clews-calibration/SKILL.md): assess
  technical validity, historical adequacy, forcing, evidence, and fitness for
  purpose.
- [`build-clews-model`](build-clews-model/SKILL.md): build and package an
  uncalibrated country CLEWS model.
- [`clews-model-review`](clews-model-review/SKILL.md): review structure and data
  consistency.
- [`fable-mode`](fable-mode/SKILL.md): apply a disciplined evidence, execution,
  and verification loop.
## The OG family

[`og/`](og/README.md) holds all OG-Core skills as one family — one directory
per skill, kept separate from the top-level CLEWS skills:

- [`og/og-country-calibration`](og/og-country-calibration/SKILL.md): calibrate
  or refine an OG-Core country model — the family's calibration playbook.
- [`og/og-run-preflight`](og/og-run-preflight/SKILL.md): GO/NO-GO preflight
  before any model run (branch+HEAD, import shadowing, per-worktree venvs).
- [`og/og-solver-diagnosis`](og/og-solver-diagnosis/SKILL.md): root-cause
  protocol for non-convergent or suspicious SS/TPI solves.
- [`og/og-repo-fleet-sync`](og/og-repo-fleet-sync/SKILL.md): propagate one
  change across the country-repo fleet, tracked.
- [`og/og-scenario-report`](og/og-scenario-report/SKILL.md): baseline-vs-reform
  outputs → standard charts, tables, narrative.
- [`og/og-analysis-studio`](og/og-analysis-studio/SKILL.md): on-demand scenario
  design, analytical exploration, bespoke visualization, and write-ups.
- [`og/worktree-orchard`](og/worktree-orchard/SKILL.md): read-only inventory of
  checkout/worktree sprawl with retirement candidates.
- [`og/calibration-provenance`](og/calibration-provenance/SKILL.md): trace any
  calibrated parameter back to its authoritative source.

See [`og/README.md`](og/README.md) for install lines (project-scoped install
into the country repos is the recommended ring).
