# OG run rules

The model owner's rules for running an OG-Core country model. They override older advice in the
OG repos, including the AGENTS.md estimate that a full example run takes "~35 min – 2 hr".

**A healthy baseline takes under ten minutes.** The steady state takes seconds to a minute or two;
the transition path about 5–7 minutes. Much longer means something is wrong (the worker pool, the
solver settings, a stale ogcore, a cold start, or the calibration), not that the model is slow.
Stop and diagnose (og-solver-diagnosis); do not wait it out.

**Install with the official installer.** Every OG model a run will report on is installed with
OG-Core's own installer, as `scripts/QUICK_INSTALL.md` in PSLmodels/OG-Core describes: download
`scripts/install.sh` (Windows: `install.ps1`) from OG-Core `master`, then
`bash install.sh --repo <key> --dest <new parent folder> --yes` (`--list` shows the keys: og-core,
og-eth, og-zaf, og-idn, og-phl, og-bra). It clones the repo, installs uv if needed, runs
`uv sync --extra dev`, and checks the import. To test a branch or a fork, install it the same way
into its own folder: `--repo-url <git URL> --branch <branch>`. Do not build an environment by hand
for a reported run: no conda environment, no `uv sync` inside an ad-hoc worktree, no `PYTHONPATH`
or `sys.path` shadowing, no `pip install` of another build. If the installer cannot produce what the
task needs, stop and ask.

**Run the shipped example script, unchanged.** From the installed folder, activate the environment
and run the example: `source .venv/bin/activate`, then `python examples/run_og_<xxx>.py`
(`uv run python examples/run_og_<xxx>.py` from that folder is equivalent). Nothing bespoke: no
driver script of your own, no edited copy of the example, no settings changed in the script, no
monkeypatching, and nothing injected into the run to observe it (wrappers, counters,
`sitecustomize`, worker plugins). Code the repo itself ships (a warm-start helper, a
multi-industry continuation solver in its example) is part of how that repo runs. If a task seems
to need a different setting or a change to the run, ask the user first, and say in the report
exactly what differed from the shipped example. The lockfile is what the repo runs: if the
environment has drifted from it, re-run the installer (or `uv sync --extra dev` in the installed
folder) and re-run the preflight; do not run the stale environment. The one remaining exception
is testing an unreleased ogcore under a country model (og-solver-diagnosis covers the pattern),
and only when the user asked for it.

**Evidence about the model comes only from such a run.** A claim that the model fails, is wrong,
has a bug, or got faster must come from an installer-installed copy running its shipped example.
Test fixtures, saved test pickles, serial runs, partial reproductions and your own drivers give
leads, not findings: label them as leads and do not report a model failure from them. Measure
after the run, not during it: diagnostics read the saved output (`OUTPUT_BASELINE`,
`OUTPUT_REFORM`) with the installed package's own functions and change nothing in the run. To
compare a code change, install `master` and the branch separately with the installer, run the
same shipped example in each, and compare the saved outputs.

**Everything as parallel as possible**, the steady state and tuning loops included. The examples
build one dask `Client(n_workers=min(cpu_count(), 7), threads_per_worker=1)` and call
`runner(p, time_path=True, client=client)` once per scenario. Workers beyond `J` idle, so seven is
full parallelism when `J = 7`. Do not build a serial steady-state driver for speed; a slow steady
state is a symptom. `runner` always re-solves the steady state, so `runner(time_path=False)`
followed by `runner(time_path=True, client=client)` solves it twice.

**Anderson every run, with `nu` 0.2 or lower**, set in the packaged parameters, not the script
(if the repo does not set them, run the example as shipped and tell the user; change nothing
without their go):
`TPI_outer_method = "anderson"`. OG-Core's default is still damped iteration with `nu` 0.4, and
some repos set Anderson but leave `nu` at 0.4, so check both. `nu` still matters under Anderson:
the trust region is anchored to the damped step. Solver field names change between ogcore
releases; check the installed version has the fields you set (`hasattr(Specifications(), ...)` in
that environment, not release tags or memory: some releases were published without a git tag), and
treat an ogcore bump as its own change. Watch the distance series the first time; if it oscillates or stalls, fall back to damped
iteration. Anderson works on the transition path only and never fixes a fiscal runaway. Evidence:
it cut PHL's single-industry transition from ~30–70 damped iterations to 11–12.

**Validation runs are offline:** `update_from_api=False`. Some example scripts call
`Calibration(p, update_from_api=True)` whenever the machine is online, which overwrites packaged
values from live sources; check the script, say whether a run was online, and record it.

**Preflight before every solve** (og-run-preflight): branch and HEAD of every repo involved,
imports resolving inside the intended checkout, its own environment. A GO is a precondition, never
an authorization.

**Launch only after the user's explicit go.** Propose the exact command, the expected duration,
and whether it runs online. One go can cover an itemised batch (the same example in five listed
countries); it never extends to runs that were not on the list. A steady-state check that takes
seconds, inside a calibration task the user has already started, does not need a separate go.

**Record what produced every output:** repo, branch and commit, ogcore version, script, the
parameters changed (solver settings included), online or not, and the date.
